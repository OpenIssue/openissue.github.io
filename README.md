Managing open source projects contributions management.

## This is repo is used to manage my open source contributions raised as issues.

## Process
1. Find source projects
1. Find issue
1. Raise an issue here.

Have not figured out how merge will work. May be I have create a separate .md file for the issue. Not sure.
